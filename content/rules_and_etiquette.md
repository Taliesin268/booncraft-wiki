title: Rules & Etiquette
---
**TL;DR:** Be kind. Don't grief. Ask before you "borrow."

For the full, authoritative list, see `/rules` in-game.

## Core Rules
- **No griefing or stealing.** Unclaimed does **not** mean free-for-all.
- **Keep chat civil.** Be polite, be family-friendly, no harassment, hate speech, or spam.
- **No cheating/x-ray/dupes.** Client-side QoL only if allowed.
- **Lag manners.** Big redstone/auto-farms? Test first; ask a mod if unsure.
- **PVP:** Consent only (opt-in for open world with `/pvpt`; PVP arena via `/warp pvp`)

## Enforcement
- Warnings → temporary mutes/bans → permanent bans for repeat/serious issues.
- **Appeals:** Open a ticket in Discord `#ban-appeal` with **date/time**, **what happened**, and **your perspective**.

Need to report something? Use `/report` in-game or contact a mod (see [[faq_and_troubleshooting|FAQ & Troubleshooting]]).
